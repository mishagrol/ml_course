    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lab of the *Reinforcement Learning* course at Skoltech CDISE! \n",
    "\n",
    "After the first two lectures and seminars of this course, you have learned about several foundational concepts in reinforcement learning. These concepts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The environment (a.k.a \"system\" in control theory language)\n",
    "* Agent (a.k.a \"controller\")\n",
    "* States and actions (state-space and action-space)\n",
    "* Disturbance\n",
    "* Discrete vs Continuous Time\n",
    "* Markov Decision Processes (MDP)\n",
    "* Policy: deterministic and stochastic policies\n",
    "* Objective functions: *reward* function and *cost-to-go* function (frequently known as the **Bellman value function**)\n",
    "* Optimization of the objective functions\n",
    "* Discounting of rewards\n",
    "* Time horizons: finite or infinite\n",
    "* The overall goal of the agent: to learn the **optimal** implicit or explicit model of the environment in order act optimally to fulfill some goal.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lab assignments offer various benefits to students. Mainly, they a) provide students with an opportunity to *apply* the theoretical concepts and methods that they learned about during lecture; b) teach students how to use technology related to the course; and c) give students an opportunity for problem-solving.\n",

    "### Before getting started: installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this lab, you first need to install *Rcognita*. You should have already done this after reading the repo README - but if you haven't then head over to Canvas and read the installation_requirements document. Note that it is a best practice to install this package into a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick review\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, you have learned about the two principle entities in reinforcement learning: the agent and the environment. At a basic level, the interaction between these two entities is as follows: the agent observes the state of the environment, calculcates and takes actions, and receives rewards and new states from the environment. This is a cyclical process <sup>[1]</sup>:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"agent_env.png\" alt=\"Agent-Env interaction\" width=55% height=55% />\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, the agent learns (an implicit or explicit policy) for taking actions that maximize reward over some time horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before we get started, a word on terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had a chance to dive into the Python code of this package on your own time, then you might have noticed some terminology that differs from more \"popular\" RL terms. I.e., you may have seen:\n",
    "* \"System\" instead of environment\n",
    "* \"Controller\" instead of agent\n",
    "* \"cost-to-go\" instead of optimal (Bellman) value function\n",
    "* \"Feedback loop\" instead of training iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "These terms are interrelated and often interchangeable. They come from systems theory, control theory, and dynamic programming. RL has evolved from these fields (among others) and thus shares many concepts with them, especially as related to mathematical processes and entity names. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, you should become acquainted with the following terms and concepts <sup>[2]</sup>:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Rcognita\n",
    "\n",
    "Rcognita is Python framework for RL training, research and visualization. The purpose of Rcognita is to train RL algorithms in a dynamic environment.\n",
    "* **Definition**: An environment is dynamic if it changes while the agent is in the process of action selection. Otherwise, the environment is static.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **environment** in Rcognita is based upon a 3-wheel robot:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"endi1.png\" alt=\"Notation\" width=40% height=40% />\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the **agent** is to learn to control the robot to move it to the target (0,0) xy-coordinates 2D Euclidean space:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"endi2.png\" alt=\"Notation\" width=40% height=40% />\n",
    "\n",
    "This training task and objective can be achieved with a variety of agent algorithms and customizations to the environment, which we will discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment inputs and outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's examine the input/output variables of the agent and environment in Rcognita in order to understand how they interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment (being the robot in Euclidean space), takes two inputs:\n",
    "* **F**: pushing force (N for Newton)\n",
    "* **M**: turning torque (Nm for Newton metre)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the agent's task to determine these two inputs and input them to the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For it's part, the environment outputs a new state, which has the following 5 characteristics:\n",
    "* **x ($x_c$)** = x-coordinate (m)\n",
    "* **y ($y_c$)** = y-coordinate (m)\n",
    "* **alpha ($\\alpha$)** = turning angle (rad)\n",
    "* **upsilon ($\\upsilon$)** = velocity (m/s)\n",
    "* **omega ($\\omega$)** = revolution speed (rad/s) (aka turning speed)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate $\\upsilon$ (velocity) and $\\omega$ (revolution speed), the environment also takes the following 2 parameters:\n",
    "* **m** = robot's mass (kg)\n",
    "* **I** = robot's moment of inertia around the vertical axis (kg m^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now formulate these variables in a mathematical representation often used in control theory. For a given time-step, $t$:\n",
    "* Action or control input is given by: $\\hspace{3mm}u_t = (F, M)$\n",
    "* Environment is given by: $\\hspace{3mm}x_t = (x_c, y_c, \\alpha, \\upsilon, \\omega)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The agent: learning how to act\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how the agent learns to pilot a 3-wheeled robot to its objective, we can study a simplified Markov Decision Process (MDP). This MDP is \"simplified\" because it is formalized from the perspective of a *deterministic* environment (instead of a *stochastic* environment).\n",
    "* **Definition**: a deterministic environment is one in which a specific action in a given state always leads to the same next state. <sup>[3]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a deterministic setting, the MDP is characterised by 3 functions:\n",
    "* The transition function: $f: X \\times U \\rightarrow U$\n",
    "* The reward function (Greek letter rho): $\\rho: X \\times U \\rightarrow R$\n",
    "* And the policy function $h: X \\rightarrow U$\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the variables defined above and applying them to these functions, below we arrive at the following simplified MDP that governs training in Rcognita.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment executes the transition function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{t+1} = f(x_t, u_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the current time-step $t$: the current state $x_t$ and controller action $u_t$ is inputted to the environment, which outputs the next state $x_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the environment also provides a signal to the agent in the form of a reward:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{t+1} = \\rho(x_t, u_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward function is the objective function that the agent seeks to maximize. (**Note**: an RL training problem may be formulized as *minimizing* the objective function, where the objective is the \"cost-to-go\". This cost-to-go is the difference between the optimal value function and the agent's *learned* value function. That is why the term cost-to-go is used and in this case we are minimizing, not maximizing).\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, the policy function. The policy is precisely what the agent needs to learn to succeed at the objective - and it is described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_t = h(x_t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus at time step $t$, the agent takes as input the state of the environment $x_t$ and outputs the action to take, $u_t$."
