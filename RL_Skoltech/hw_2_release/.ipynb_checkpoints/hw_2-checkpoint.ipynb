    "#### First, a recap of homework 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In homework 1 we applied value iteration and policy iteration to an environment with discrete state and action spaces (aka a finite MDP). If you recall, the environment we used (FrozenLake 4x4) had 16 states and 4 actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The algorithms from hw 1 have several characteristics:\n",
    "* The tabular representations of MDP variables had to be stored in memory:\n",
    "    * In the case of VI, the values of states, transitions, and rewards were stored in memory and referenced when calculating the best action to take\n",
    "    * In the case of PI, policy was additionally stored in memory.\n",
    "* Neither value nor policy functions were represented mathematically/analytically\n",
    "* Both value iteration (VI) and policy iteration (PI) were *repeatedly and reliably* able to solve the environment (when `is_slippery==False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The problem with *Exact Value Iteration* and *Exact Policy Iteration*\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with VI and PI from homework 1 is that when MDP variables (states, actions, transitions, or rewards) \"have a very large or infinite number of possible values (e.g., when they are continuous)\", then Tabular/stored \"representations are no longer possible, and value functions and policies need to be represented approximately\" <sup>[2]</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine this issue in more specific terms. Examine the following VI algorithm <sup>[1]</sup>:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"vi.png\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is nearly identical to VI from hw 1. What problems/deficiencies can you identify in this algorithm if we had to scale it by 30 orders of magnitude? \n",
    "\n",
    "At least 5 problems/deficiencies come to mind with regard to scale <sup>[1]</sup>:\n",
    "1. All of the states are iterated over (line 3)\n",
    "2. Value of state $V(s)$ is stored for every state (line 5)\n",
    "3. Policy $\\pi$ is stored for every state (line 6)\n",
    "4. The expected return over future states ($s^\\prime$) is calculated recursively for all $s^\\prime$ (lines 5 and 6)\n",
    "5. Maximization is performed over all possible actions (lines 5 and 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing VI and PI algorithms for **continuous** state and/or action spaces, all of these problems can be addressed with **approximation**, which, when applied to the DP methods (such as VI and PI) is known as **Approximate Dynamic Programming**.\n",
    "\n",

    "The following concepts will help you in completing this assignment and furthering your understanding of common taxonomy in the field of RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming vs Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming refers to a class of optimization methods that solve problems through recursion and aggregation, or more formally by \"by combining solutions from their subproblems\" <sup>[1]</sup>.\n",
    "<blockquote><b>DP algorithms</b> require a model of the MDP, including the transition dynamics\n",
    "and the reward function, to find an optimal policy (Bertsekas, 2007; Powell, 2007).\n",
    "Usually, they do not require an analytical expression of the\n",
    "dynamics. Instead, given a state and an action, the model is only required to generate a next state and the corresponding reward. Constructing such a generative model is often easier than deriving an analytical expression of the dynamics, especially when the dynamics are stochastic.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, in reinforcement learning algorithms, the underlying model of the environment is unknown:\n",
    "<blockquote><b>RL algorithms</b> are model-free (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996; Sutton and Barto, 1998), which makes them useful when a model is difficult or costly to construct. RL algorithms use data obtained from the process, in the form of a set of samples, a set of process trajectories, or a single trajectory. So, RL can be seen as model-free, sample- based or trajectory-based DP, and DP can be seen as model-based RL. While DP algorithms can use the model to obtain any number of sample transitions from any state-action pair, RL algorithms must work with the limited data that can be obtained from the process – a greater challenge. Note that some RL algorithms build a model from the data; we call these algorithms “model-learning.”<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Offline vs Online\n",
    "\n",
    "From [2]:\n",
    "> * Offline RL methods are applicable if data can be obtained in advance. \n",
    "> * Online RL algorithms learn a solution by interacting with the system, and can therefore be applied even when data is not available in advance. For instance, intelligent agents are often placed in environments that are not fully known beforehand, which makes it impossible to obtain data in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deterministic vs Stochastic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deterministic**\n",
    "    * > A deterministic MDP is defined by the state space $X$ of the process, the action space $U$ of the controller, the transition function $f$ of the process (which describes how the state changes as a result of control actions), and the reward function $\\rho$ (which evaluates the immediate control performance). <sup>[2]</sup>\n",
    "* **Stochastic**\n",
    "    * > In a stochastic MDP, the next state is not deterministically given by the current state and action. Instead, the next state is a random variable, and the current state and action give the probability density of this random variable. <sup>[2]</sup>"
