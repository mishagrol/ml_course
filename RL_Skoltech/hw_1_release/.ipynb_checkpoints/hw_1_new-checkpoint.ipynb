    "### Background material \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, let's refresh our memory on this question: what is the core problem that is being solved for in reinforcement learning? \n",
    "\n",
    "At the simplest level, the problem we are solving for is to teach the agent to behave *optimally* in a specific environment. An example might be to teach a robot to bounce a ball for some period of time; or program a helicopter to keep the same altitude in unpredictable windy conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical definition of what is *optimal* is defined by the **objective function**, which is typically maximized in the context of MDPs (Markov Decision Processes). In the context of MDPs , this objective function is known as the **value function**, aka the *total expected reward*, which is received over sequential state transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal then, is to teach the agent to maximize the *total expected reward* it earns over some time horizon (theoretically, it is an infinite time horizon) by selecting the best action as dictated by the value function. The agent learns to maximize rewards as it transitions from state to state, taking actions in each state. In a deterministic case, the transitioning process is diagrammed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{State 1}\\xrightarrow[Action]{}\\text{State 2} \\xrightarrow[Action]{}\\text{State 3}\\xrightarrow[Action]{}\\dots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's formalize the key components of the RL problem in the context of MDPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "An MDP is defined by: $(S, A, P, R, S_0, \\gamma)$\n",
    "* S = set of states (state-space)\n",
    "* A = set of actions (action-space)\n",
    "* P = state transition probabilities\n",
    "* R = reward for taking an action $a\\in\\text{A}$ in state $s\\in\\text{S}$\n",
    "* $S_0$ = starting state\n",
    "* $\\gamma$ = discount rate\n",
    "    \n",
    "In more detail:\n",
    "* **States** - states can be discrete/finite (imagine cells in a grid world) or continuous/infinite (position on a road).\n",
    "    * Referred to as the *state space* (i.e. discrete state space or continuous state space)\n",
    "* **Actions** - actions can also be discrete (moving up/down/left/right in a grid world cell) or continuous (how many degrees to turn a steering wheel when driving a car).\n",
    "    * Referred to as the *action space* (i.e. discrete action space or continuous action space)\n",
    "* **Rewards** - rewards are issued by a reward function $\\rho : S_t \\times A_t \\rightarrow R$. The reward function is a property of the environment.\n",
    "* **Transition probabilities**. In MDPs, this is denoted by $P_{s,a}$. The transition probability is the probability that, for example, some action $A$ in state $S$ leads to state $S^\\prime$ (prime denotes the next time step) - represented notationally as $p(s^\\prime|s,a)$.\n",
    "* **Discount factor** - the discount factor is a number greater than 0 and less than 1 that is used to discount rewards received over sequential time-steps. It is denoted as $\\gamma \\in [0, 1)$\n",
    "* **Value function** - one of the primary functions learned by the agent: the value function dictates either the value of a state or the value of action. More on this below.\n",
    "* **Policy function** - one of the primary functions learned by the agent: the policy maps states to actions. More below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other useful definitions\n",
    "* **Experience** - $\\big(\\text{State}_{t}$, $\\text{Action}_{t}$, $\\text{Reward}_{t}\\big)$ tuple\n",
    "* **Trajectory** - A sequence of *experiences* through time, represented as: $\\tau$ (tau)\n",
    "* **Episode** - A trajectory that ends in a terminal state\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of learning for the agent can be thought of as a sequence of mapping states to actions $a = \\pi(s)$ to maximize expected reward over an episode. This is known as the **policy:** $\\pi: S \\rightarrow A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "* The agent needs to explore and interact with its environment to learn where actions earn the maximum rewards.\n",
    "* Actions in the current time step effect rewards in future time steps\n",
    "* There is a trade off between the frequency of sampling the environment and frequency of taking actions\n",
    "* It can be based on discrete state-spaces or continuous state-spaces (and same for action-spaces)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The **worthiness** of a policy is calculated by the aforementioned *value function*. There are various forms of value functions. First, the value of a state <sup>[3]</sup>:\n",
