In particular, we will examine and implement 5 different algorithms, all of which are based on Monte-Carlo prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Off-line learning v.s. On-line learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Off-line:\n",
    "* Offline RL methods are applicable if data can be obtained in advance and in bulk.\n",
    "* This means that the dataset is acquired in a prior phase (to the training phase of the model). \n",
    "    * In other words: model training happens separately from model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On-line:\n",
    "* Online learning is an approach that ingests data one observation at a time, as the data comes in from the environment.\n",
    "* Online RL algorithms learn a solution by interacting with the system, and can therefore be applied even when data is not available in advance.\n",
    "* In other words, training and evaluation happen sequentially in a single simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### On-policy learning v.s. off-policy learning\n",
    "\n",
    "On-policy:\n",
    "* In on-policy learning, we 1) start with a single policy 2) use it to determine next actions and states, and 3) at each time step (interaction with the environment), we optimize this policy to improve it. Usually, policy optimization involves stochastic methods for exploration, either in action sampling or introducing disturbance into the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Off-policy:\n",
    "* Off-policy entails the use two policies, whereby one policy (the \"behaviour\" policy) is used for taking steps and collecting samples in order to optimize the other (\"target\") policy. Usually, in this case the behaviour policy is used to enhance how exploration is done, and its key purpose is to collect samples to improve the target policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sutton's words, page 110 <sup>[1]</sup>:\n",
    "> Recall that the distinguishing feature of on-policy methods is that they estimate the value of a policy while using it for control. In off-policy methods these two functions are separated. The policy used to generate behavior, called the behavior policy, may in fact be unrelated to the policy that is evaluated and improved, called the target policy. An advantage of this separation is that the target policy may be deterministic (e.g., greedy), while the behavior policy can continue to sample all possible actions."

    "\n",
    "In chapter 5 of the class text<sup>[1]</sup>, Sutton describes Monte Carlo (MC) methods-- \"used for estimating value functions and discovering optimal policies\". One of the benefits of MC methods comes from the fact that they do not require knowledge of the environment:\n",
    "> Monte Carlo methods require only experience—sample sequences of states, actions, and rewards from actual or simulated interaction with an environment. Learning from actual experience is striking because it requires no prior knowledge of the environment’s dynamics, yet can still attain optimal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sutton clarifies that the MC methods presented in chapter 5 \"[are used for solving] reinforcement learning problem based on **averaging sample returns**\". Note that these methods are:\n",
    "> * Only incremental in an episode-by-episode sense, **but not in a step-by-step (online) sense.**\n",

    "MC prediction methods can be combined with deep learning by serving as trainers (aka supervisors) of neural networks. In this exercise, we'll review such implementions in both *off-line* and *on-line* learning cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=\"blue\">Problem 2.1 - Algorithm 2</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let's examine how the MC policy from problem 1.1 can be used as a supervisor for a neural network-based policy in the case of an <font color=\"8F00FF\">**off-line**</font> and <font color=\"8F00FF\">**off-policy**</font> method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm consists of two parts:\n",
    "* The trainer agent\n",
    "* The actor agent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does it work\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the trainer agent is solely to train the NN with an MC policy. It does so in two steps:\n",
    "1. Plays out a full episode taking steps with an MC policy. It saves all of its actions and states into buffers.\n",
    "2. Then, it trains the NN with the actions and states stored in the buffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards the actor agent performs step 3:\n",
    "3. It uses the trained NN policy to play an episode\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important takeaways as far as RL taxonomy goes:\n",
    "* Because the training (steps 1 and 2) happens separately from model evaluation (step 3), this algorithm is an example of <font color=\"8F00FF\">**off-line learning**</font>.\n",
    "* Because the NN policy is not concurrently optimized **and** used for step-taking during the simulation, this is an example of an <font color=\"8F00FF\">**off-policy** algorithm</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Task 1 - implement the NN trainer in the code below\n",

    "***\n",
    "Let's start this exercise by reviewing temporal difference learning from chapter 6 in the class text. What is the difference between TD and MC? <sup>[1]</sup>:\n",
    "> Both TD and Monte Carlo methods use experience to solve the prediction problem. Given some experience following a policy $\\pi$, both methods update their estimate $v_{\\pi}$ for the nonterminal states $S_t$ occurring in that experience. Roughly speaking, Monte Carlo methods wait until the **return** following the visit is known, then use that return as a target for $V(S_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sutton continues on page 120 <sup>[1]</sup>:\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Whereas Monte Carlo methods must wait until the end of the episode to determine the increment to $V(S_t)$ (only then is $G_t$ known), TD methods need to wait only until the next time step. At time $t + 1$ they immediately form a target and make a useful update using the observed reward $R_{t+1}$ and the estimate $V(S_{t+1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest TD method makes the update: \n",
    "$$V\\left(S_{t}\\right) \\leftarrow V\\left(S_{t}\\right)+\\alpha\\left[R_{t+1}+\\gamma V\\left(S_{t+1}\\right)-V\\left(S_{t}\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "immediately on transition to $S_{t+1}$ and receiving $R_{t+1}$. In effect, the target for the Monte Carlo update is $G_t$, whereas the target for the TD update is $R_{t+1}$ + $V(S_{t+1})$. This TD method is called TD(0), or one-step TD, because it is a special case of the $TD(\\cdot)$ and n-step TD methods developed in Chapter 12 and Chapter 7. The box below specifies TD(0) completely in procedural form.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sutton_120.png\" width=70% height=70% />\n",
    "    \n",
    "Roughly speaking, Monte Carlo methods use an estimate of (6.3) as a target, whereas DP methods use an estimate of (6.4) as a target. The Monte Carlo target is an estimate because the expected value in (6.3) is not known; a sample return is used in place of the real expected return. The DP target is an estimate not because of the expected values, which are assumed to be completely provided by a model of the environment, but because $V(S_{t+1})$ is not known and the current estimate, $V(S_{t+1})$, is used instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TD target is an estimate for both reasons: it samples the expected values in (6.4) and it uses the current estimate V instead of the true $v_{\\pi}$. Thus, TD methods combine the sampling of Monte Carlo with the bootstrapping of DP. As we shall see, with care and imagination this can take us a long way toward obtaining the advantages of both Monte Carlo and DP methods.\n",

Even in the limited simulations above, keeping all variables fixed, Sarsa algorithm *tends* to have a bit higher RMSE of Trajectory than Q-learning (though again, this is not guaranteed because of the e-greedy policy). This means that in the sims above, Sarsa tends to have a less linear path towards (0,0) xy-coords. \n",

This dramatically simplifies the analysis of the algorithm and enabled early convergence proofs. The policy still has an effect in that it determines which state–action pairs are visited and updated. However, all that is required for correct convergence is that all pairs continue to be updated. As we observed in Chapter 5, this is a minimal requirement in the sense that any method guaranteed to find optimal behavior in the general case must require it. \n",
